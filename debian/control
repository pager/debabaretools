Description: The Debian Bash-Based Repository Tools
 Set of scripts or "glues" between different builders and repository tools
 in order to provide an automated repository system.
 .
 It is intended to hand over all the job to other tools but coordinates
 the whole operation.
 .
 It is NOT a rewrite of a repository tool (i.e. reprepro, debarchiver), 
 neither yet an other building tool (i.e. sbuild, pbuilder).
